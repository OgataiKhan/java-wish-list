# Java Wishlist

This is an exercise intended to practice the use of ArrayLists in Java.

The program will read the current wishlist from a text file if one exists (or create one if it doesn't).  
Then it will ask the user to add more gifts to the list, printing the current length at each iteration.  
When the user stops, it will print the updated list into the console and save it onto the file.

## Bonus Challenge: Character Counter

The program asks the user for an input string and uses a HashMap to print each letter's frequency.
